## Introduction

Cosmos Chronicles is my fifth project with Code Institute. The idea for Cosmos Chronicles has been around since I started with my first project. I have been wanting to do a project based on one of my other passions Astronomy. Cosmos Chronicles is based off CI's Moments Walkthrough, which allowed my idea of creating a place for space enthusiants to come together and post about everything astronomy.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

 - I wanted the colours of the site to be space related. I wanted to also try out gradient as a background colour, which allowed it to look a bit like a galaxy. My favourite colour is orange, so I wanted to add that as well. I was having a bit of trouble with the gradient due to having certain colours different depending on where they were on the page.

### Acknowledgments

- Again, and for the last time, I'm truly grateful for my mentor, Martina. She has been the best mentor someone could ask for. 

- Oisin and John from Tutor Support, who helped with a few "TINY" issues that came up. 

- My husband who has encouraged me throughout the course, and, of course, my animals who have been okay with me being in front of a computer and not being a bed for them to relax. After this I can go back to being a bed.
