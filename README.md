## üî≠ Introduction

Cosmos Chronicles is my fifth project with Code Institute. The idea for Cosmos Chronicles has been around since I started with my first project. I have been wanting to do a project based on one of my other passions Astronomy. Cosmos Chronicles is based off CI's Moments Walkthrough, which allowed my idea of creating a place for space enthusiants to come together and post about anything astronomy.

## üî≠ User Experience

### Project Goals

Cosmos Chronicles was designed for space enthusiants. Cosmos Chronicles is for anyone whose passion is, as they say in Star Trek, "The Final Frontier"! A place where user can posts about what they saw through their telescope or what their students did for space-themed day. A place for news about launches, update on various missions, or what is happening across space agencies can be posted. Also, a place where events can be posted and people would know where they can meet to experience space events. 

### Audience

Who can use this site? Anyone from astrobiologists who might do this on a daily bases to librarians whose passions are a bit more then books.

### Colour Scheme

I wanted Cosmos Chronicles to have colours that will be space themed. I wanted to try gradient as a background, but there was some difficulties. These difficulties became apparent more in the navbar. Because of the gradient there was a dark and light colour and the colour of the text in the navbar had to show through those colours. Even though the difficulties were there I was able to work around and still use the gradient for the project. 

Gradient colour used for the background

### Typography

- [Reddit Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Reddit+Mono?query=reddit+mono) from Google Fonts was used for Cosmos Chronicles.

### Imagery

- Images have been obtained from Pexel and NASA Photojournal. One photo came from a co-workers testing the site (photo of the chocolate cake).

- All images will be credited in the [Media](#media) section.

### Wireframes

- For Cosmos Chronicles's wireframes, I used Balsamiq. After going through the CI's Moments Walkthrough, I based Cosmos Chronicles's wireframes on that. I added so

### Future Implementations

- Box underneath Popular Profiles to show new updates whenever someone updates news or events. When clicked it will redirect to either the News or Events section.

- When someone posts in the News or Events section it automatically populates in the Home page.

- Add a live feed for NASA TV from YouTube.

- Create a section where the community can take part in astronomy themed citizen science.

### Acknowledgments

- Again, and for the last time, I'm truly grateful for my mentor, Martina. She has been the best mentor someone could ask for. 

- Oisin and John from Tutor Support, who helped with a few "TINY" issues that came up. 

- My husband who has encouraged me throughout the course, and, of course, my animals who have been okay with me being in front of a computer and not being a bed for them to relax. After this I can go back to being a bed.
